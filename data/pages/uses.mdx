My setup is in a constantly evolving state and tech comes and goes, therefore changes can be expected to be made.  This is current as of the time of posting.

### Editor + Terminal
*  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the editor of choice for any language I program in for just about everything.
*  [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) from the amazing [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) for my VS Code themeing.
*  For a font I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with ligatures enabled.  Ligatures are amazing.
*  As a Windows 10 user I run WSL debian image with [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/), [ZSH Shell](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

### Desktop Apps
*  Browser of choice still is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and occasionally [Firefox Dev](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).
*  [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/) are the primary chat applications I use to interact with different communities.
*  For notetaking and todo lists I use [Trello](https://trello.com/), I really ❤ the Kanban board style of it.
*  [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/index-dd.html) provides offsite backups to my entire PC just in case.

### Browser Extensions
*  [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) for password management because we shouldn't be doing that manually anymore.
*  [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) this seems pretty explanatory
*  [Apollo Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm?hl=en-US) in the age of GraphQL this is a must
*  Biggest one for me is [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) because somehow at the age of 30 I still can't spell many things correctly!

### Hosting
*  All of my websites and services are hosted on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
*  Image support provided by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
*  CDN and DNS for my websites comes from [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
*  All websites use [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) for their registration

### Workspace
*  My main development machine is an [Asus G771JW](https://www.asus.com/us/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-G771JW/) that while a little short on resource these days and atrocious battery life has been a solid performer for me.  Equipped with 16gb of ram and a 1TB [Samsung Evo 970+](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-plus-nvme-m-2-1-tb-mz-v7s1t0b-am/) SSD as well as 2TB drive for backups.
*  Still performing but not great in color reproduction is my [Samsung T260HD](https://www.samsung.com/us/business/support/owners/product/touch-of-color-series-t260hd/) 26" 1200p monitor.
* [Das Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/) mechanical keyboard, because yes all Das Keyboard owners must mention it!
* [Sennheiser](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/headphones) HD595 headphones with [FiiO](https://www.fiio.com/) E7+E9 headphone DAC/AMP
